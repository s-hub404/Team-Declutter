# Team-Declutter

Our Model is based on recycling, reusing Electronics Devices. We have used 4 Flagship Mobile's Data in our prototype, to predict their Depreciated prices based on our Statistical Price Depreciation Model.
We have approached this using Python, Pandas to read our Datasets to implement our logic.
Deployed our Model using streamlit, to create a web app prototype.
